This is what happens when you get a list of detections

1) Create adjacency list between all past detections in a category and new detections
2) Those with the highest iou area are sequentially popped off and the detection object is then modified to update status of number of times object has been seen
3) Those that have not been touched because minimal iou are edited accordingly
4) Every of the new detections that has not been touched is added as a new detection
5) Only pass as end output objects that have been detected for more than x frames
6) Do garbage collection / status checking to delete old objects
7) Pass all detections as output in function
8) Implement some basic kinematics to predict future position which can be used with kalmann filter and reading to get accurate future localizer at time step k which can be used for iou analysis
